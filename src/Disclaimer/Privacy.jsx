          <p>
            This website is designed to provide to the public information
            concerning our services, to collect information from persons
            interested in contacting us to obtain those services, and to enable
            our lawyers to contact potential clients. This privacy policy
            (“Policy”) applies only to the online collection of information from
            users of this website. If you contact a lawyer through the use of
            this website and establish a professional relationship with that
            lawyer (known as a “solicitor-client” relationship), any personal
            information you share with that lawyer will be subject to the
            professional obligation to maintain confidentiality as established
            by the Rules of Professional Conduct and the law and not by this
            Policy. Please note that submitting information through this website
            does not create a solicitor-client relationship between you and any
            of our lawyers. Only a direct contact between you and an individual
            lawyer creates such a relationship.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
          <p>
            Personal information means any information about or that can be used
            to identify you as an individual, including details such as the
            matter about which you contacted this website and any other
            information that you choose to provide. In most circumstances,
            personal information does not include most information that might
            appear on a business card or information that is available in public
            records, nor does it include corporate information such as your
            business address or telephone number in your capacity as an employee
            of an organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the applicable Digital Security Act 2018, the ICT Act 2006, we
            follow ten principles when collecting, using or disclosing your
            personal information:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We are accountable for personal information under our control.
            </li>
            <li>
              The purpose for collecting personal information is identified at
              or before the time it is collected.
            </li>
            <li>
              We obtain your consent before collecting, using or disclosing your
              personal information, except where otherwise permitted or required
              by law.
            </li>
            <li>
              We limit the personal information we collect to that which is
              necessary for us to conduct business.
            </li>
            <li>
              The personal information we collect is only used, disclosed or
              retained for its original intended purpose (unless you provide
              your consent to a different use or disclosure) and we retain it
              only as long as necessary for those purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              We take care to ensure that the information we have is accurate,
            </li>
            <li>
              We safeguard the privacy of your personal information through
              security measures.
            </li>
            <li>
              We are open with you about our policies and practices related to
              managing your personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon request, we provide you with access to your personal
              information, subject to any limitations imposed by law.
            </li>
            <li>
              We address your concerns. If you have questions or concerns
              regarding your privacy or this Policy please contact us as
              described below.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Your Consent</h2>
          <p>
            By providing us with your personal information, you consent to the
            collection, use and disclosure of that information as described in
            this Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not, as a condition of supplying our services, require you
            to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal
            information beyond that required to enable us to provide the
            requested services.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may refuse to give personal information and may, subject to
            legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, withdraw
            consent at any time to the continued use and disclosure of personal
            information previously collected. The period of reasonable notice
            will vary depending on the nature of the information and its
            purpose. We will inform you of the implications of refusing or
            withdrawing consent, which may have legal consequences or preclude
            us from providing our services.
          </p>
          <h2>What personal information is collected through this website?</h2>
          <p>
            We will not collect personal information indiscriminately. We will
            limit the amount and the type of information we collect to that
            necessary to fulfil the purposes we have identified to you, or as
            otherwise permitted or required by law. We may also collect
            information about your business and business interests or your
            personal interests to better serve you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We collect information about our users in three ways: directly from
            the user, from our Web server logs and through cookies. We use the
            information primarily to provide you with a personalized Internet
            experience that delivers the information, resources, and services
            that are most relevant and helpful to you. We don’t share any of the
            information you provide with others, unless we say so in this
            Policy, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
          </p>
          <h2>User-supplied information</h2>
          <p>
            If you fill out the contact form on this website, we will ask you to
            provide some personal information (such as e-mail address, name,
            phone number, etc.). We only require that you provide an e-mail
            address on the contact form. Please do not submit any confidential,
            proprietary or sensitive personally identifiable information (e.g.
            National Identification Card No; date of birth; driver’s license
            number; or credit card, bank account or other financial information)
            (collectively, “Sensitive Information”). If you submit any Sensitive
            Information, you do so at your own risk and we will not be liable to
            you or responsible for consequences of your submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you establish a solicitor-client relationship with a particular
            lawyer, you may be required, in the context of that relationship, to
            provide Sensitive Information for the purpose of conducting legal
            services. As noted above, such information is outside the scope of
            this policy and should never be submitted through this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Information that you provide to us through the contact form will be
            used so that we may respond to your inquiry. We may also use
            information you provide to us to communicate with you in the future.
            If you do not wish to receive such communications, you may opt out
            (unsubscribe) as described below.
          </p>
          <h2>Web Server Logs</h2>
          <p>
            Our website is hosted on servers shared with an Internet service
            provider (ISP). Any personal information collected on our behalf by
            the ISP, such as server log data (see below), is managed in
            accordance with this Policy and is protected by applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain information about Internet users’ traffic patterns is
            passively and automatically collected and linked to users’ Internet
            Protocol (“IP”) addresses. These unique IP addresses are assigned to
            all Web users by their ISPs, and are automatically logged by
            Internet servers. While the IP address itself does not identify an
            individual, it may, in appropriate circumstances such as an
            investigation of a security breach, be used with the cooperation of
            the ISP to locate and identify an individual using the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the normal course of establishing and maintaining Internet
            connections, our servers automatically log information about visits
            to our website. Server logs record statistical information, such as
            a visitor’s IP address and type of operating system, the time and
            duration of visit and Web pages requested. The server logs also
            identify categories of visitors by items such as domain and browser
            type. These statistics are reported in aggregate form to us and are
            used to improve our website and ensure that it provides the optimal
            online experience for visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not link server log information to any other data in a way
            that would enable us to identify individual visitors, except for
            security purposes, as discussed above.
          </p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Like many other websites, our Site makes use of “per session” cookie
            technology. Per session cookies are small text files that contain a
            unique identification number that is automatically deposited on a
            visitor’s computer. These cookies track information during an open
            session and are stored only temporarily in your computer’s memory.
            This information helps us determine the total number of visitors to
            the Site on an ongoing basis and the types of Internet browsers and
            operating systems that our visitors use. We use this information to
            facilitate and enhance your online visits. We do not cross-reference
            this information with any type of personal information that is
            voluntarily offered through the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The use of cookie technology is common on the Internet, and many
            Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies automatically.
            If you would prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your Internet
            browser to notify you when your computer is receiving a cookie or to
            refuse cookies automatically. To readjust your Internet browser’s
            cookie options, please refer to the instruction documentation of
            your particular browser or seek online assistance. You should
            understand that some features of many sites may not function
            properly if you don’t accept cookies.
          </p>
          <h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use personal information only as described in this Policy or as
            otherwise permitted or required by law. Before your personal
            information is used or disclosed for a new purpose, we will ask for
            your consent unless use or disclosure without your consent in the
            circumstances is otherwise permitted or required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary purpose of collection of your personal information on
            this website is to mutually determine if the legal services of our
            member lawyers are right for you. To that end, we will share any
            information you submit with our member lawyers and persons working
            with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use your personal information to send you newsletters
            about our services or about legal developments that we think would
            interest you. We regularly distribute practice group bulletins,
            articles and other legal updates and publications to people on our
            mailing lists, who can elect to receive materials on one or more
            subject matters. At any time, you may change your preferences or
            unsubscribe from our mailing lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you send personal information through our site, we will use it to
            assess website use and traffic, and to respond to your feedback,
            questions and comments.
          </p>
          <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We disclose personal information only as described in this Policy or
            as otherwise permitted or required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, we will not disclose your information to anyone other
            than our member lawyers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we may disclose your information to service providers
            inside or outside Bangladesh retained by us to assist us with
            marketing or other services, including technical support and
            mailing. We limit the service provider’s right to use the personal
            information only for the services it provides to us, and we require
            the service provider to maintain the confidentiality of the personal
            information and to take steps to protect the security of the
            personal information we provide.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we are unable to assist with your matter, but know an
            unaffiliated attorney or firm that may be able to help you, we may
            refer you and share information you provided us with that party.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your personal information may be accessed or stored in Bangladesh or
            another jurisdiction, and if it is accessed and stored in another
            jurisdiction it will be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction.
            For example, we may allow certain authorized third-party providers
            to track and store certain information about visitors to the web
            site (namely domain names, IP addresses and page views) and such
            information will be stored outside of Bangladesh if the third-party
            provider is located outside of Bangladesh. Individuals that use and
            access this website hereby acknowledge and agree that such
            information obtained by such third-party providers located in
            countries other than Bangladesh may be accessed by the courts, law
            enforcement or national security authorities of such country.
          </p>
          <h2>Retention of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We will retain information, including personal information, for as
            long as it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected.
            The length of time we retain information varies, depending on the
            service and the nature of the information. This period may extend
            beyond the end of a person’s relationship with us but it will be
            only for so long as it is necessary for us to have sufficient
            information to respond to any issues that may arise at a later date.
          </p>
          <h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use the standard safeguards to protect the security of personal
            information in our possession, including physical, organizational
            and technological measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of communicating Personal Information to us, please note
            that there is no method of transmitting or storing data that is
            completely secure. Transmissions over the Internet are susceptible
            to possible loss, misrouting, interception and misuse of the
            information being communicated or transmitted.
          </p>
          <h2>Your Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            You can ask to view your personal information by writing to us. You
            can request that corrections be made where you can show that the
            information we possess is inaccurate. Please note that under certain
            circumstances, you may not be permitted to view your records for
            example, where the disclosure of your records would cause security,
            legal or confidentiality concerns.
          </p>
          <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
          <p>
            The site may contain links to other websites. While we try to link
            only to websites that share our standards and respect for privacy,
            we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of other
            websites. We strongly encourage all site visitors to review the
            privacy statements and policies of all external websites.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may amend this Policy at any time. We will post the Policy as
            amended on our website. We will obtain the necessary consents
            required under applicable privacy laws if we seek to collect, use or
            disclose your personal information for purposes other than those to
            which consent has been obtained unless otherwise required or
            permitted by law.
